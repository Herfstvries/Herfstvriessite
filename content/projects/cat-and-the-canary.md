We composed and arranged original music for the silent film The Cat and the Canary, a silent comedy/horror movie from 1939. The music we wrote was performed live by the Keuris Ensemble during the screening of the film in EYE Amsterdam.

During this projected we really enjoyed experimenting with different orchestrations and sound design.

A great addition to this project was the big theater organ that is located in the main theater of the museum.
